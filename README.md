## Mento Website Clone Project 

This is our fourth Construct Week Project at Masai School's Full Stack Web Development Course. We are currently at the end of fifth unit where we need to make project as per mastery based progression environment of _Masai School_ ,  after learnig certain tech-tools and in fourth unit we have learnt React JS, Redux by using which we need to create website clones. So the motto of this project is to create *Mento* website clone. 

   We often end up in careers or industries because we are either confused or clueless about what we want to do in life. Also, we don't actually have much information about the numerous career options available to us. So Mento is an online platform which aims to solve that problem by providing first hand in-depth career advice from the biggest and best in each field. You'll get all the information you need to decide if a particular career is for you or not.
   
 ##  Tech-stack used
  
   ```
   Frontend : HTML, CSS, Javascript, React JS, Redux
   
   Backend   : Node JS, EXpress, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, npm 
   ```

  So it was a great experience to us while building this task we have learnt so many new concepts and how to apply tech-tools whatever we have learnt in our current unit. The project covers basic front end designs up to a certain level and showcasing basic functionality like signup, signin, product viewing, adding it to cart then finally placing order by filling address details and making successful payment. I greatly thankful to my instructor *Swanand Kadam* and also instructor associate *Kamal* for guiding us which helpled me to feel confident and work upon the project and to complete within the specified time period.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
